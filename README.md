### Project Structure

This project has been divided into two repositories: one for the client and this one for the server. The server utilizes a structured approach with routes and controllers to ensure maintainability and scalability of the codebase. It includes schemas and middleware for data validation of incoming HTTP requests and features a data model used for storing information in a MongoDB database.

### Server

The server consists of routes for performing operations such as getAll, getById, update, delete, and create.


### Deploy

The server is deployed on render platform.
